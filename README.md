# Will-the-Customer-Accept-the-Coupon
Answering if a  customer would accept a restaurant coupon delivered to their cell phone. The restaurant coupon would be delivered when they pass by said restaurant while driving. This data comes to us from the UCI Machine Learning repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk.

This central portion of this analysis examins 2 coupon types - Bar coupons and Carry out & Take away coupons, and at what rate / percentage various subsets of the driver population accept these coupons. A summary of the findings for each is below, and a link to the full analysis and report is provided at the end.


**Bar Coupon Hypotheses:**

1. Drivers will accept bar coupons less than half the time overall (41.2%).

2. Drivers who go to the bar on average more than 3 times per month will accept bar coupons at more than twice the rate (76.2%) of drivers who don't (37.3%).

3. Drivers older than 25 who go to the bar on average more than once a month will accept bar coupons at a much higher rate (~68.3%) than the overall population of drivers (41.2%).

4. Drivers who go to the bar more than once a month on average, have a passanger that's not a kid, and have an occupation outside of farming, fishing, and forestry will accept bar coupons at a much higher rate (71.4%) than the overall population (41.2%).
